# Deep-Learning-Based-Personality-Recognition-Using-Social-Media-Posts
The goal is to predict an individual's Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) based on their 
written content on social media platforms. The dataset consists of a large sample of social media users' posts from various platforms, including Twitter and Facebook. The deep learning model is trained on a subset of the data and validated using another subset. The results demonstrate that deep learning algorithms can accurately predict an individual's personality traits from their social media content.
The Deep Learning Model used is LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)
